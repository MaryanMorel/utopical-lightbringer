		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>
			This website displays a tweet classification made with machine learning techniques.
			<br/><br/>
			In few words, this is how it works:
			<ol>
			<li>We retrieve the recents tweets of all the people your are following</li>
			<li>We explore these tweets and the metadata of the link they refers to</li>
			<li>We contruct a graph in which two users we be close and hence connected, if they use the same terms in their tweets</li>
			<li>We use a machine learning technique called spectral clustering to find clusters in this graph</li>
			<li>We display tweets by users in their respective cluster</li>
			</ol>
